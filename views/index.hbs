      <p>Unfortunately none of us will live forever (yet). Your loved ones may not know what you'd like to do with your favourite things or your money when you are no longer of this world (it's hard to make decisions when you are dead).
      </p>
      <p>Did you know that if your assets are over $15,000 <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2009/0070/latest/DLM1934408.html">(prescribed amount in law)</a>, then you will need a will to help your executor/administrator (person administrating your estate) save on legal costs? When you die, your executor/administrator will need to apply to the High Court for either Probate (when there's a valid will) or Letter of Administration (when there's no will). Lawyers generally charge more for Letter of Administration, so it also makes sense to have a will! 
      </p>
      <p>A will is a legal document you sign while you are alive so your executor (someone who will step into your shoes to wrap up your finances, properties and things) will know what your wishes are. Your executor could be anyone (as long as they are an adult): your child, your spouse, your best friend etc. So it's important to be clear about what you want (in order to make your executor's job easier).

      <p>REMEMBER: a will can be challenged (by anyone who feels entitled to your estate). This means you might not have your wishes carried out if it can be challenged. So keep in mind the possible people who might challenge your will when you are writing it. An example of people who might challenge a will are:
      <ul>
        <li>children from a previous relationship</li>
        <li>someone you have had a serious relationship with (regardless whether you are married and/or have kids with this person)</li>
        <li>children (natural or adopted) that you have left out of your will</li>
        <li>someone you have promised to give something to when you die</li>
        <li>things that you aren't normally allowed to do by law</li>
      </ul>
